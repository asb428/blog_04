            <p>Article talks about modern technologies artists started using in their art creation during and after global pandemic.
                Article mentions few main technologies - AI, robots, Virtual reality, and sensors.
                As part of AI technology used in art, a lot of artists use GAN (Generative adversarial networks). A lot of artwork made with help of GAN helps to create abstract images based on the databases and code corrections made my artists themselves.
                Robots have many variations when used as part of art creation. Some could be a part of installation, some use brain waves of an artist to 'participate' in art creation. 
                VR is mostly used for how art is displayed today. Virtual museums and galleries are created using VR and AR technilogies. 
                Modern web technologies also assit artists and galleries in art trade and securing art pieces, and some can even be used in art restoration process. 
                Although moder web technoligies are helpful in creating and developing art, the future is still unclear. Article is also rising an existing threat to an art that artists may face.

                The problem of space debris is raising and now there is an enormous amount of spaceships' pieces floating around the orbit.
                The International Space Station tries to regularly remove the most dangerous debris pieces as there were already few cases of pieces falling back on Earth.
                Nowadays the space communities speculate that even if all the spaceships launches are stopped, space debris is going to increase because of the collisions.
                Now the Spacee community is trying to design and develop new tools that will be able to remove the majority of debris from the orbit, and keep exploring and developing moder rocket technologies.

                COVID-19 pandemic opened to researchers and scientists new opportunities of how to use VR technologies. Researcher Stephen Hilton started using VR labs to conduct researchers
                with his collegues from Germany and United States, who were struggling when using video conferences alone. Today, Hilton uses his labs to train students in 'real environment'
                with AI assistants. Students can freely practice and conduct experiments in safe environment. VR and XR is now widely used in labs and medical trainings, where medical students
                can practice performing operations and surgery.
