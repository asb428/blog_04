                Article mentions few main technologies - AI, robots, Virtual reality, and sensors.
                As part of AI technology used in art, a lot of artists use GAN (Generative adversarial networks). A lot of artwork made with help of GAN helps to create abstract images based on the databases and code corrections made my artists themselves.
                Robots have many variations when used as part of art creation. Some could be a part of installation, some use brain waves of an artist to 'participate' in art creation. 
                VR is mostly used for how art is displayed today. Virtual museums and galleries are created using VR and AR technilogies. 
                Modern web technologies also assit artists and galleries in art trade and securing art pieces, and some can even be used in art restoration process. 
                Although moder web technoligies are helpful in creating and developing art, the future is still unclear. Article is also rising an existing threat to an art that artists may face.
